Given an array with N integer numbers your task is to print to the standard output (stdout) the smallest K numbers among them.
Note: In a real world scenario N is expected to be the order of millions and K the order of hundreds

Expected complexity: lower than O(NlognN)
Example input:
K = 3
V = 9 1 3 7 2 2
Example output:
1 2 2
Example input:
K = 2
V = 1 2 8 7 3 3 1
Example output:
1 1
